# Mac mini Mrscraper

The shared Mac. A second account also uses this machine, so
`enableAggressiveTweaks` is **false** here (see `../README.md`), which keeps
Homebrew `cleanup = "none"` and leaves the other account's packages alone.

## Host-only casks

`homebrew.casks` here is **merged** with the shared list in
`../../../modules/darwin/homebrew/default.nix`; nix-darwin concatenates list
options across modules, so nothing has to be repeated. Anything declared in
this file installs on the Mac mini only.

Microsoft Edge lives here rather than in the shared list on purpose. The
MacBook and beast run `cleanup = "zap"`, so putting a cask in the shared list
installs it on every Mac on their next rebuild, and removing it later would
uninstall it **with its data** there. A host-local entry sidesteps both.

Nothing in the darwin config pins a default browser, so adding a browser here
does not change which one opens links.

## Never sleeps

`power.sleep` only exposes the computer, display and disk timers. The
`pmset-never-sleep` launchd daemon re-applies the rest at boot —
`disablesleep`, `standby`, `autopoweroff`, `hibernatemode` and `powernap` —
which nix-darwin has no options for.
